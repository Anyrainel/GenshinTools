1. Remove the at least N stat input setting per build. Instead make it some global setting during the computation stage.
2. Consider adding manual labels to characters (scaling stats, roles, etc), then remove the custom name for builds, and instead make it use a list of labels.
3. Rethink how to generate artifact filters to ensure better quality filters (not too strict, not too loose either). Either change algorithm, or add more configurable steps to the algorithm. As an exmaple, instead of showing the probability of the filter at "at least N+1", make it a configurable setting to auto bump the number when the probability is too high. Also maybe consider how to prioritize 4pc builds over 2pc builds during computation.
